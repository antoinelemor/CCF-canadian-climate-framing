{"text": "The loss of the $280 million (U.S.) mission came a month after Japan launched the world's first spacecraft to track global warming emissions.

{"text": "That is about 0.13 per cent of the world’s roughly 37 billion metric tons of annual energy and industry-related carbon dioxide emissions. Some 30 of those projects, accounting for 78 per cent of all captured carbon from the group, use the carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in which carbon is injected into oil wells to free trapped oil.", "label": 1}

{"text": "What originally looked like a modest commitment may in the end amount to as much as a 25-per-cent reduction in emissions by the time the phase-in period of 2008-2012 begins. Moreover, the country's geography and industrial makeup suggest that not only will Canada have to cut emissions more than other countries but that also the cost per ton of carbon reduction will be relatively high.", "label": 0}
{"text": "This rule supports our economy, and the safety of American families.\" Opponents contend the change - gutting his predecessor's legacy effort against climatechanging fossil-fuel emissions - appears to be driven by Trump's push to undo regulatory initiatives of former president Barack Obama and say even the administration has had difficulty pointing to the kind of specific, demonstrable benefits to drivers, public health and safety or the economy that normally accompany standards changes.", "label": 0}
{"text": "That's despite increasingly urgent warnings from scientists that humans are running out of time to stave off the harshest effects of climate change by cutting harmful emissions from consuming coal, oil and natural gas.

{"text": "The only way to avoid that would be to make carbon pricing revenue neutral, returning all the money raised from Canadians to them, as income tax cuts or grants. This would create a realworld demand for low-carbon consuming goods and services - because they would be less expensive - while providing Canadians with the money to buy them, avoiding a recession.", "label": 0}
