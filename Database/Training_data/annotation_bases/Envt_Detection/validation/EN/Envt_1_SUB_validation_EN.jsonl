In B.C., alarm bells are beginning to ring about future prospects for drinking water, agriculture irrigation, hydroelectric supply, Pacific salmon habitat and winter tourism.", "label": 1}

In Manitoba, climate change over the last 100 years has increased the average temperature of Lake Winnipeg by two degrees in the southern basin and one degree in the north, creating better conditions for blue-green algae to bloom.", "label": 0}
