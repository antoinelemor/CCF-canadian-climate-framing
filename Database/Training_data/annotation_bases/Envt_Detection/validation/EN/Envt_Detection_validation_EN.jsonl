The fact the U.S. position that the developing world must accept hard targets is shared by Canada, Russia and Japan shows that, contrary to the nonsense we've been hearing from the opposition parties, Canada is not isolated in its perfectly logical argument that combating global warming has to be done globally, not just by 37 out of 194 countries, as is now the case with Kyoto.", "label": 0}
