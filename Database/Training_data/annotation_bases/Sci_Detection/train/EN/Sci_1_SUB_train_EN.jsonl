{"text": "That the IEA feels the need to put that high in the foreword to its latest long-term energy outlook gets at the problem: To a large degree, it doesn't matter that it isn't prophesying. Because of the IEA's stature and the fact that not many institutions have the inclination or funding to maintain detailed models of global energy supply and demand - plus our species'preference to just reach for ready-made statistics - the World Energy Outlook tends to be treated as a reference work rather than a mere thinking aid.", "label": 1}

While I recognize it is not only irresponsible but also statistically incorrect to causally link any one given weather event to climate change, the bleak scientific reality is that oceans are becoming increasingly desalinated, sea levels are rising, extreme heat waves and prolonged droughts are worryingly commonplace, and sea surface temperatures are warmer, all due to climate change.", "label": 1}
