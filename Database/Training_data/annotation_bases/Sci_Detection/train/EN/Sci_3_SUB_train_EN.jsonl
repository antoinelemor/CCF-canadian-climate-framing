{"text": "The UCL report's co-author Mark Maslin told the BBC: “There is a marked cooling around that time (1500s-1600s) which is called the Little Ice Age, and what's interesting is that we can see natural processes giving a little bit of cooling. But actually, to get the full cooling — double the natural processes — you have to have this genocide-generated drop in CO2.\"", "label": 0}
{"text": "Climate change is already affecting everything from the fires in the Fort McMurray region to drought in California and elsewhere.
