{"text": "Co-authored by University of Ottawa geology professor Dr. Jan Veizer and University of Toronto-trained astrophysicist Dr. Nir J. Shaviv, this study shows that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the gas most targeted by Kyoto, has had little effect on Earth's long-term temperature variations compared to natural causes. In a unique cross-disciplinary study, Veizer and Shaviv combined their perspectives of Earth sciences and astrophysics to show the primary driver of Earth's major climate swings over the past half-billion years almost certainly originates with the most violent natural phenomenon known -- supernovas, the cataclysmic explosions that end the normal life of the galaxy's largest stars.", "label": 0}

Under the highest-warming scenario, the Burke team had projected a 49-per-cent global GDP loss from climate change by 2100, but Newell found the model variant that fits their data best implied a slight global GDP gain.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Against the prevailing wisdom, he was increasingly convinced that mass extinctions could have been caused through global cataclysm, such as meteorite impact or a widespread volcanic eruption.
