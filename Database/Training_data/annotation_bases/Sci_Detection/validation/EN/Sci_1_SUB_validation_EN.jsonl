{"text": "This observed warming hiatus contrasts with the expectation from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report that warming would proceed at a rate of 0.2oC/per decade in the early decades of the 21st century. The warming hiatus raises serious questions as to whether the climate model projections of the 21st century have much utility for decision making, given uncertainties in climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide, future volcanic eruptions and solar activity, and the multi-decadal and century-scale oscillations in ocean circulation patterns.", "label": 0}

Lying along the north coast of Ellesmere Island, Canada's northernmost territory, the 443-square-kilometre ice shelf had supported the Arctic's largest epishelf lake - an ice-entombed body of fresh water that provided scientists a unique natural laboratory for studying a \"cryo-habitat\" where some of the Earth's rarest micro-organisms live.", "label": 0}
{"text": "It turns out that many senior climate experts belong to the heretic party in one respect or another, and Mr. Revkin produces quotes that might surprise those who haven't noticed how often the catastrophist position is advanced by those who have no scientific standing at all.

{"text": "The new data was presented this week at a small annual gathering of Great Lakes scientists in Cornwall, Ont., and will be published as part of a larger U.S.-Canadian study of the region by the International Joint Commission, due in 2006. The figures were based on previous modelling by federal climatologists and the IJC -- a U.S.-Canadian body that arbitrates bi-national water issues -- suggesting that higher temperatures theoretically linked to greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, along with greater water evaporation, may lead to \"frequent and more intense\" periods of drought in the Great Lakes basin.", "label": 0}
