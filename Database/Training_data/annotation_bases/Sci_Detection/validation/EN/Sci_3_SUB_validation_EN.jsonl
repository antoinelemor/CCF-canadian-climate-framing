Weaver said the controversy has obscured the fact that two other independent sets of data -- both produced by researchers based in the United States -- show that, if anything, the British data is underestimating the severity of the situation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "But by then, the political context in which this debate took form was tilted heavily toward the views of market fundamentalists, who fought to weaken existing constraints and scoffed at the possibility that global constraints would be needed to halt the dangerous dumping of global-warming pollution into the atmosphere. Over the years, as the science has become clearer and clearer, some industries and companies whose business plans are dependent on unrestrained pollution of the atmospheric commons have become ever more entrenched.", "label": 0}

It began, the book says, with fossil fuel industry associations, which had the most to lose financially from any serious attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by curbing the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.", "label": 0}
