{"text": "Salter's Flettner ships have also sailed into stormy waters. Lenton has calculated that they could cope with half the projected carbon emissions during the coming century, but Stephen Schneider, from Stanford University, says that oceanic currents and winds might distribute the cooling effect unevenly, resulting in even greater climatic change.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The CRU leaks showed many of the world's leading climate scientists discussing how they could torque their research to show more recent warming than there has been, conceal their \"tricks\" from other scientists and government investigators, and pressure scientific journals not to publish reports by dissenting scientists. Then a couple of weeks ago came the news that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN's climate-change arm, had based its most recent findings on Himalayan glacier melt on an old study that had never been peer-reviewed or even published and which was based entirely on the speculation (not research) of a single Indian scientist who now works at the environmental think-tank run by the head of the IPCC, economist Rajendra Pachauri.", "label": 0}
